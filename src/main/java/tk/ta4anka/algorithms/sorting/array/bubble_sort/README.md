###  Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a comparison-based algorithm that measures up each pair of array elements and swaps them

when theyâ€™re out of order until the entire array is sorted. The algorithm compares every pair of elements

in the list for each element in the list
***
- In-place algorithm
- Stable sort algorithm
- O(n^2) time complexity - **quadratic**
- It will take 100 steps to sort 10 items
- Algorithm degrades quickly
