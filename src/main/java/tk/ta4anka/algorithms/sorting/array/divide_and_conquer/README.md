### Divide and Conquer technique

Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm in which the problem is solved using the Divide, Conquer, and Combine strategy.

A typical Divide and Conquer algorithm solves a problem using following three steps:

- **Divide:** This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
- **Conquer:** Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
- **Combine:** Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.
